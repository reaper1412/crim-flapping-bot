Verbosity Levels [http://wiki.ros.org/Verbosity%20Levels]

DEBUG
Information that you never need to see if the system is working properly. Examples:
"Received a message on topic X from caller Y"
"Sent 20 bytes on socket 9".

INFO
Small amounts of information that may be useful to a user. Examples:
"Node initialized"
"Advertised on topic X with message type Y"
"New subscriber to topic X: Y"

WARN
Information that the user may find alarming, and may affect the output of the application, but is part of the expected working of the system. Examples:
"Could not load configuration file from <path>. Using defaults."

ERROR
Something serious (but recoverable) has gone wrong. Examples:
"Haven't received an update on topic X for 10 seconds. Stopping robot until X continues broadcasting."
"Received unexpected NaN value in transform X. Skipping..."

FATAL
Something unrecoverable has happened. Examples:
"Motors have caught fire!"
